_The biggest driving force in EE today is energy consumption, even in US where the energy policy is ambiguous at best._

In 2012, 3% of the power consumption in EU was due to the equipment supporting the internet infrastructure (EU Commission annual reports). This is very significant, as the data rates keep going up so the trend is that it will go higher. Seeing that, a lot of grants were given to telecomms manufacturers, startups, and universities to reduce losses in existing opto-electronic systems. Powering a laser to send data over hundreds of km is expensive, esp as the lasers need to be cooled at a very stable temperature or their operational parameters change.

But it does not stop here. Wind energy is no longer an alternative. it is now a solid energy branch that can supply a good baseline power if the farms are spread over a large area.

**Disadvantage:** grid needs to be very robust. There is a need to switch these on/off, and it is not a trivial problem (disconnecting a MW generator as it operates presents a fire risk for instance), hence there is the debate towards which direction do we need to focus the research on. 


## **The hybrid drivetrain debate:**

As of 2014, most personal automobiles can be considered hybrids or hybrid-ready to various degrees. For instance, some manufacturers have adopted smaller turbocharger engines that can be started and stopped at will as you idle (stop) or cruise at a very steady speed. In the carburetor era, this was inconceivable, due to the amount of fuel wasted at each cycle.

The thing is a complex hybrid drivetrain is becoming heavy with all sorts of auxiliary systems and driving assists. TRW are researching ways to do fully electronic power steering and some cars already feature this. But the design question is whether the added weight isn't hurting fuel/energy consumption which is a major factor for most people today when they buy a new car.

Also, going fully electric is not realistic for the time being, because it goes back to the aged electrical grid problem, which can't be simply switched off and replaced over night. These costs would be passed on to the consumers in the end, which nobody really wants.

_The trend of energy consumption can be best seen in semiconductors, particularly computing hardware for the average consumer._

Most people don't need a lot of hardware for browsing the internet or checking their e-mail. I can do that on my cellphone, whose System on a Chip that includes a CPU draws \<1 W at full load. My 3y old laptop had a 35W processor with another 20W going to the video card at full load. The new one has a 15W processor for about 10% less of the raw performance of the latter, and the video card is included on chip.
The battery capacity of both laptops is comparable, but one lasted 2h:30 when it was new, the new one lasts 8h+.

a bit over a decade ago, the general trend in electronics seemed to be: more, faster, better, cheaper! but in recent times this was amended towards: more, faster, better,cheaper, if reasonably efficient & not significantly harmful to the environment.
  

## **Other big debates come with user interaction.**

Touch screen vs keyboard? Better gesture recognition? voice recognition? Self-guided/adjusting sensors? Is it worth all that? Though this sort of technology has always seemed to be 30y into the future, placed corectly, they change the way we do maintenance in industrial environments and can make it horribly convenient for the end user (i.e. wipers that start as liquid splashes the windscreen or suspension that becomes higher and softer on a bumpy road.)

it is important because man-machine interaction is bound to become more important in the upcoming years, and paired with the low energy demands, similar technologies will enable blind people to see and the deaf to hear, among other things.

I'm a _traditionalist_, meaning that every time a key disappears from a laptop keyboard I get upset. But if the software is programmed to do the right job as well, i can keep an open mind. The only thing about it is that people tend to develop a blind confidence in technology very easily: when it's good, it's good. When it fails: it's added weight at best, confusing & crippling at worst.
