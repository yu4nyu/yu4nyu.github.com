>Don't call it uncertainty —— call it wonder. Don't call it insecurity —— call it freedom.

翻译：不要称其为不确定性 —— 称其为奇遇。不要称其为不安全性 —— 称其为自由。

>A Buddha is a Buddha, a Krishna is Krishna, and you are you. And you are not in any way less than anybody else. Respect yourself, respect your own inner voice and follow it.

翻译：佛陀是佛陀，Krishna神是Krishna神，而你是你。你不比任何其他人少什么。尊重你自己，尊重你内在的声音并跟从他。

>Don't try to understand life. Live it! Don't try to understand love. Move into love. Then you will know —— and that knowing will come out of your experiencing. That knowing will never destroy the mystery: The more you know, the more you know that much remains to be known.

翻译：不要试图去理解生活。去生活！不要试图去理解爱。投身去爱！然后你将知道 —— 知识出自经验。知识将永远不会摧毁神秘：你知道得越多，你也越知道，有很多东西依然还需要去了解。

>Just see it: how can you trust anybody or anything if you don't trust yourself? It is impossible. If you doubt yourself how can you trust? It is you who are going to trust, and you don't trust yourself —— how can you trust your trust? It is absolutely necessary that the heart should be opened before intellect can be transformed into intelligence.

翻译：如果你不信任你自己，你怎么能信任任何人和事？那不可能。如果你对自己有疑虑，那你如何去信任？是你要去信任，然后你不信任自己 —— 那你怎么能信任你的信任？在智力转换成智慧之前，打开内心是必须的。

>Intelligence is intellect in tune with your heart.

翻译：智慧是和内心协调一致的智力。

>In fact, only fools give advice, and only fools take advice. Wise people are very reluctant to give you advice because a wise man certainly knows that the only thing in the world which is given freely is advice, and that which is never taken by anybody is advice, so why should we bother?

翻译：实际上，只有傻子才会提供建议，也只有傻子才会接受建议。智者们会很不愿意给你建议，因为一个智者明确地知道，这个世界上唯一能免费给与的就是建议了，而不会被人接受的也是建议，所以为什么我们要为此费心？

>…that the ego is your past memory and nothing else, that you are not your memory, that memory is just like a biocomputer, that it is a machine, a mechanism, utilitarian, but you are beyond it… your are consciousness, not memory. Memory is a content in consciousness, you're consciousness itself.

翻译：...自我不是其他东西，那是你过去的记忆。你不是你的记忆，记忆只是像一个生物计算机，是一个机器，一种机制，是实用的工具，但你是超越于此的... 你是意识，不是记忆。记忆是意识的内容，你是意识本身。

>A man really becomes a man when he accepts total responsibility —— he is responsible for whatsoever he is. This is the first courage, the greatest courage.

翻译：当一个人完全接受责任，他会真正成为一个人 —— 他会为任何他成为的样子负责。这是第一的勇气，最伟大的勇气。

>REMEMBER, BRAVE DOES NOT MEAN FEARLESS. If somebody is fearless you cannot call him brave. You cannot call a machine brave; it is fearless. Bravery exists only in the ocean of fear, bravery is an island in the ocean of fear. Fear is there, and in spite of the fear one takes a risk —— that is bravery. One trembles, one is afraid to go into the dark, and still one goes. That is the meaning of being brave. It does not mean fearless. It means full of fear but still not being dominated by it.

翻译：记住，勇敢并不意味着无所畏惧。如果某个人无所畏惧，你不能称其为勇敢。你不能称一台机器勇敢，那是无所畏惧。勇敢只存在于恐惧的海洋中，勇敢是恐惧海洋中的一座岛。恐惧就在那里，然而尽管有恐惧，一个人依然去冒险 —— 那是勇敢。一个人因为害怕黑暗而颤抖，但是他依然会前进。那是勇敢，而不是无所畏惧。那是充满恐惧却不被恐惧所统治。

>Love should be one of the most natural things, but it is not. On the contrary, it has become the most difficult thing —— almost the impossible thing. Hate has become easy; you are trained, you are prepared for hate. To be a Hindu is to be full of hate for Mohammedans, for Christians, for Jews; to be a Christian is to be full of hate for other religions. To be a nationalist is to be full of hate for other nations.

翻译：爱应该是最自然的事情之一，但事实却不是。相反，那变成了最困难的事情 —— 几乎是不可能的事情。憎恶变得简单。你被训练，做好准备去憎恶。成为印度教徒，意味着对穆斯林，对基督教徒，对犹太教徒充满憎恶。成为基督教徒，意味着对其他宗教充满憎恶。成为民族主义者，意味着对其他国家充满憎恶。

>The who are courageous, they go headlong. They search all opportunities of danger. Their life philosophy is not that of insurance companies. Their life philosophy is that of a mountain climber, a glider, a surfer. And not only in the outside seas they surf; they surf in their innermost seas. And not only on the outside they climb Alps and Himalayas; they seek inner peaks.

翻译：有勇气的人会勇往直前。他们搜索所有危险的机会。他们的人生哲学不是需求安稳。他们的人生哲学是登山者，滑翔者和冲浪者的哲学。他们不仅仅是在外在的海洋里冲浪，也在内心最深处冲浪。他们不仅仅是攀爬外在的阿尔卑斯和喜马拉雅，也在寻求内心的峰顶。

>Money is needed. It is a need. But money is not the goal and cannot be the goal. A house is needed, certainly. It is a need. I am not an ascetic and I don't want you to destroy your houses and escape to the Himalayas. The house is needed —— but the house is needed for you. Don't misunderstand it.<\br>
>As I see people, the whole thing has gone topsy-turvy. They exist as if they are needed for the house. They go on working for the house. As if they are needed for the bank balance —— they simply go on collecting money and then they die. And they had never lived. They had never a single moment of throbbing, streaming life. They were just imprisoned in security, familiarity, respectability.

翻译：钱是需要的，那是必须品。但是钱不是目的也不能是目的。房子当然也是需要的，那是必须品。我不是苦行者，我不是想让你毁掉你的房子然后逃到喜马拉雅山。房子是需要的 —— 但是房子是你需要它。不要搞错了这一点。<\br>
但我看到人们把所有的事情颠倒过来了。他们存在是因为房子需要他们。他们为了房子工作。也好像银行存款需要他们 —— 他们只是赚钱然后死掉。他们从来没有生活过。从来没有内心的悸动和感受生活的河流的时刻。他们仅仅是被禁锢在安全，熟悉和受尊重的环境中。

>"You are getting old and you are still killing time. Can't you see that really time is killing you?"

翻译：“你在变老，而你依然在打发时间。难道你不知道是时间在打发你吗？”

>It is very easy to think about love. It is very difficult to love. It is very easy to love the whole world. The real difficulty is to love a single human being. It is very easy to love God or humanity. The real problem arises when you come across a real person and you encounter him. To encounter him is to go through a great change and a great challenge.

翻译：思考爱很容易，但是去爱却很难。去爱整个世界很容易，真正难的是去爱一个实实在在的人。去爱上帝和人类很容易，但当你真正遇到一个人，问题就会产生。相遇意味着巨大的改变和挑战。

>Religion is the strangest business of all. There is no boss, but there are mediators: the priest, the bishop, the cardinal, the pope, the messiah, the whole hierarchy —— and on top there is nobody.

翻译：宗教是世界上最奇怪的事务。没有老板，但是有中间人：牧师、主教、红衣主教、教皇和弥赛亚，一整个层级结构 —— 在最顶上没有任何人。

>There is nothing to fear.

翻译：没有什么是值得畏惧的。

书名翻译过来叫《勇气：生活在危险中的乐趣》。不过这本书不是讲丛林冒险的危险故事，而是讲勇气与拥抱不确定性的人生哲学。

这本书非常口语化，读完才知道原来是根据演讲的音频和视频整理出来的。但是全书也不乏妙语警句，而且逻辑也较清晰。读之前有了解了一下作者的生平，发现作者本人曾经在美国大受欢迎，最后却因为各种劣迹和丑闻而身败名裂。尽管如此，这本书所传达的智慧和哲学，依然值得一读。

书中的哲学有一些基于宗教：道家的无为和无畏，佛家的身外物的思想，甚至有一些转世轮回的观念，但作者却明确否认宗教的存在，否认宗教的作用。和很多东方的哲学一样，作者试图去创造一个简化的世界观，来诠释爱、恨和恐惧等等人的思想和观念。有点像宗教，也有点像哲学。此外，通篇作者多次提到冥想的作用，最后甚至用专门的篇章来讲述冥想的好处。能读出一点源于印度的神秘学的意味，伪科学和智慧的一种杂糅。

读这本书对于我来说很及时。从一年前开始，我开始有了对于自己职业生涯的迷茫，之后是在待在自己的舒适区、别人对自己的期待和放手去闯去做自己最想做的事情之间的内心纠结和考量。慢慢地到最后做出自己的决定，决定听从自己的内心，去做自己最想做的事情，哪怕可能没有收入来源，甚至可能以失败告终。但是就像这本书里所提到的，拥抱不确定性，这何尝不是一种乐趣？总之，我对自己生活的新篇章充满了期待。

诸君共勉之。
