>All emotions are, in essence, impulses to act, the instant plans for handling life that evolution has instilled in us. The very root of the word emotion is motere, the Latin verb "to move", plus the prefix "e-" to connote "move away", suggesting that a tendency to act is implicit in every emotion. That emotional lead to actions is most obvious in watching animals or children; it is only in "civilized" adults we so often find the great anomaly in the animal kingdom, emotions — root impulses to act — divorced from obvious reaction.

>"Anatomically the emotional system can act independently of the neocortex," LeDoux told me. "Some emotional reactions and emotional memories can be formed without any conscience, cognitive participation at all." The amygdala can house memories and response repertoires that we enact without quite realizing why we do so because the shortcut from thalamus to amygdala completely bypasses the neocortex. This bypass seems to allow the amygdala to be a repository for emotional impressions and memories that we have never known about in full awareness. LeDoux proposes that it is the amygdala's subterranean role in memory that explains, for example, a startling experiment in which people acquired a preference of oddly shaped geometric figures that had been flashed at them so quickly that they had no conscious awareness of having seen them at all!

>As Henry Roth observed in his novel Call It Sleep about this power of language. "If you could put words to what you felt, it was yours." The corollary, of course, is the alexithymic's dilemma: having no words for feelings means not making the feelings your own.

>Being able to enter flow is emotional intelligence at its best; flow represents perhaps the ultimate in harnessing the emotions in the service of performance and learning. In flow the emotions are not just contained and channeled, but positive, energized, and aligned with the task at hand. To be caught in the ennui of depression or agitation of anxiety is to be barred from flow. Yet flow (or a milder microflow) is an experience almost everyone enters from time to time, particularly when performing at their peak or stretching beyond their former limits. It is perhaps best captured by ecstatic lovemaking, the merging of two into a fluidly harmonious one.

>Meanwhile, boys and girls are taught very different lessons about handling emotions. Parents, in general, discuss emotions — with the exception of anger — more with their daughters than their sons. Girls are exposed to more information about emotions than are boys: when parents make up stories to tell their preschool children, they use more emotion words when talking to daughters than to sons; when mothers play with their infants, they display a wider range of emotions to daughters than to sons; when mother talk to daughters about feelings, they discuss in more detail the emotional state itself than they do with their sons — though with the sons they go into more detail about the causes and consequences of emotions like anger (probably as a cautionary tale).

>Some of the reasons are patently obvious — imagine the consequences for a working group when someone is unable to keep from exploding in anger or has no sensitivity about what the people around him are feeling. All the deleterious effects of agitation on thinking reviewed in Chapter 6 operate in the workplace too: When emotionally upset, people cannot remember, attend, learn or make decisions clearly. As one management consultant put it, "Stress makes people stupid."

>Whenever people come together to collaborate, whether it be in an executive planning meeting or as a team working toward a shared product, there is a very real sense in which they have a group IQ, the sum total of the talents and skills of all those involved. And how well they accomplish their task will be determined by how high the IQ is. The single most important element in group intelligence, it turns out, is not the average IQ in the academic sense, but rather in terms of emotional intelligence. The key to a high group IQ is social harmony. It is this ability to harmonize that, all other things being equal, wil make one group especially talented, productive, and successful, and another — with members whose talent and skill are equal in other regards — do poorly.

>Informal networks are especially critical for handling unanticipated problems. "The formal organization is set up to handle easily anticipated problems," one study of these networks observes. "But when unexpected problems arise, the informal organization kicks in. Its complex web of social ties form every time colleagues communicate, and solidify over time into surprisingly stable networks. Highly adaptive, informal networks move diagonally and elliptically, skipping entire functions to get things done."

>In brain terms, we can speculate, the limbic circuitry would send alarm signals in response to cues of a feared event, but the prefrontal cortex and related zones would have learned a new, more healthy response. In short, emotional lessons — even the most deeply implanted habits of the heart learned in childhood — can be reshaped. Emotional learning is lifelong.

>A key social ability is empathy, understanding others' feelings and taking their perspective, and respecting differences in how people feel about things. Relationships are a major focus, including learning to be a good listener and question-asker; distinguishing between what someone says or does and your own reactions and judgements; being assertive rather than angry or passive; and learning the arts of cooperation, conflict resolution, and negotiating compromise.

>"Dreams are private myths; myths are shared dreams"

这本书书名直译为《情绪智力》，和我们通常理解的情商类似，但读完感觉还是有点差别。我们常说某人“情商高”，是指一个人在和他人沟通和交往中，善于表达自己的想法和情绪，和“性格外向”有一些交叉的部分。而书中讲到的情绪智力，则更偏重于对于情绪本身的掌控能力，这就包括能正确地了解自己的情绪，同时也能很好地理解他人的情绪。

要想准确地了解自己的情绪，尤其是当下的情绪，首先要能用准确的词汇将它描述出来。就像书中的一句话的大意说的：“只有能描述的情绪，才是你自己所能拥有的情绪”，我对这句话的理解是，如果我们缺乏足够的语言来描述自己的情绪，那么我们也无法理清这些情绪的来龙去脉，更别说掌控他们了。

作为阐述情绪智力的专著，书中自然要从各种不同的场景来探讨情绪智力起作用或者缺失时的情形：由情绪失控引起的极端暴力、日常和他人的相处、家庭的和睦、病人的康复、心理创伤等等话题。总之一句话，较高的情绪智力能带来更好的生活质量，而情绪智力本身是能后天通过学习和训练习得的。本书在最后的章节还专门介绍了一些在美国针对小学生情绪智力的教育项目。

我从小是一个内向又自卑的小孩，后来大了一点又变成了一个情绪易波动的愤青。而到现在快要接近而立之年，大概是要感谢自己经历的人和事，当然也还有自己的努力，现在的我，在书中提到的情绪智力上，有了可以说是飞跃般的提升。当我在上学直到刚开始工作的时候，我会觉得和人打交道是一件极痛苦又没有意义的事情，写一辈子的代码才是最幸福的事情。而现在的我，既能享受进入心流的状态专心编写和调试计算机程序的过程，也更愿意去和各种不同的人面对面交流。很喜欢沉思录里说过的一句话:“我们生来是为合作的，如双足、两手、上下眼皮、上下排的牙齿。”。而要能实现自身更大的价值，为社会创造更多贡献，就应该学会更好地去和他人协作。因此，提高自己的情绪智力是一件很重要的事情，而这也如书中所言：情绪智力的学习是一辈子的事情。

诸君共勉之。
