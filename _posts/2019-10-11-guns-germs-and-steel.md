>Third, don't words such as “civilization”, and phrases such as “rise of civilization,” convey the false impression that civilization is good, tribal hunter-gatherers are miserable, and history for the past 13,000 years has involved progress toward greater human happiness? In fact, I do not assume that industrialized states are “better” than hunter-gatherer tribes, or that the abandonment of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle for iron-based statehood represents “progress,” or that it has led to an increase in human happiness.

>I'm not thereby implying that apples could never have been domesticated in North America. Recall that apples were historically among the most difficult fruit trees to cultivate and among the last major ones to be domesticated in Eurasia, because their propagation requires the difficult technique of grafting. There is no evidence for large-scale cultivation of apples even in the Fertile Crescent and in Europe until classical Greek times, 8,000 years after the rise of Erasian food production began. If Native Americans had proceeded at the same rate in inventing or acquiring grafting techniques, they too eventually have domesticated apples, around the year A.D. 5500, some 8,000 years after the rise of domestication in North America around 2500 B.C.

>...the famous first sentence of Tolstoy's great novel Anna Karenina: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” By that sentence, Tolstoy meant that, in order to be happy, a marriage must succeed in many different respects: sexual attraction, agreements about money, child discipline, religion, in-laws, and other vital issues. Failure in many in any one of those essential respects can doom a marriage even if it has all the other ingredients needed for happiness.

>When I was young, American schoolchildren were taught that North America had originally been occupied by only about one million Indians. That low number was useful in justifying the white conquest of what could be viewed as an almost empty continent. However, archaeological excavation, and scrutiny of the descriptions left by the very first European explorers on our coasts, now suggest an initial number of around 20 million Indians. For the New World as a whole, the Indian population decline in a century or two following Columbus's arrival is estimated to have been as large as 95 percent.<br/>
The main killers were Old World germs to which Indians had never been exposed, and against which they therefore had neither immune nor genetic resistance.

>Chinese writing is not purely logographic, nor is English writing purely alphabetic. Like all alphabetic writing systems, English uses many logograms, such as numerals, $, %, and + : that is, arbitrary signs, not made up of phonetic elements, representing whole words.

>These familiar examples deceive us into assuming that other major inventions were also responses to perceive needs. In fact, many or most inventions were developed by people driven by curiosity or by a love of thinkering, in the absence of any initial demand for the product they had in mind. Once a device had been invented, the inventor then had to find an application for it. Only after it had been in use for a considerable time did consumers come to feel that they “needed” it. Still other devices, invented to serve one purpose, eventually found most of their use for other, unanticipated purposes. It may come as a surprise to learn that these inventions in search of a use include most of the major technological breakthroughs of modern times, ranging from the airplane and automobile, through the internal combustion engine and electric light bulb, to the phonograph and transistor. Thus, invention is often the mother of necessity, rather than vice versa.

>With the rise of chiefdoms arounds 7,500 years ago, people had to learn, for the first time in history, how to encounter strangers regularly without attempting to kill them.

>Concealed at the top of Figure 19.2 is our first surprise, a big shock for Eurocentric believers in the superiority of so-called Western civilization. We're taught that Western civilization originated in the Near East, was brought to brilliant heights in Europe by the Greeks and Romans, and produced three of the world's greatest religions: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Those religions arose among peoples speaking three closely related languages, termed Semitic languages: Aramaic (the language of Christ and the Apostles), Hebrew and Arabic, respectively. We instinctively associate Semitic peoples with the Near East.
However, Greenberg determined that Semitic languages really form only one of six or more branches of a much larger language family, Afro-asiatic, all of whose other branches (and other 222 surviving languages) are confined to Africa. Even the Semitic subfamily itself is mainly African, 12 of its 19 surviving languages being confined to Ethiopia. This suggests that Afroasiatic languages arose in Africa, and that only one branch of them spread to the Near East. Hence it may have been Africa that gave birth to the language spoken by the authors of the Old and New Testaments and the Koran, the moral pillars of Western civilization.

>The histories of the Fertile Crescent and China also hold a salutary lesson for the modern world: circumstances change, and past primacy is no guarantee of future primacy. One might even wonder whether the geographical reasoning employed throughout this book has at least become wholly irrelevant in the modern world, now that ideas diffuse everywhere instantly on the Internet and cargo is routinely airfreighted overnight between continents. It might seem that entirely new rules apply to competition between the world's peoples, and that as a result new powers and emerging—such as Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, and especially Japan.<br/>
On reflection, though, we see that the supposedly new rules are just variations on the old ones. Yes, the transistor, invented at Bell Labs in the eastern United States in 1947, leapt 8,000 miles to launch an electronics industry in Japan—but it did not make the shorter leap to found new industries in Zaire or Paraguay. The nations rising two new power are still ones that were incorporated thousands of years ago into the old centers of dominance based on food production, or that have been repopulated by peoples from those centers. Unlike Zaire or Paraguay, Japan and the other new powers were able to exploit the transistor quickly because their populations already had a long history of literacy, metal machinery, and centralized government. The world's two earliest centers of food production, the Fertile Crescent and China, still dominate the modern world, either through the immediate successor states (modern China), or through states situated in neighboring regions influenced early by those two centers (Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Europe), or through states repopulated or ruled by their overseas immigrants (the United States, Australia, Brazil). Prospects for world dominance of sub-Saharan Africans, Aboriginal Australians, and Native Americans remain dim. The hand of history's course at 8000 B.C. lies heavily on us.

>Prediction in history, as in other historical sciences, is most feasible on large spatial scales and over long times, when the unique features of millions of small-scale brief events become the average out. Just as I could predict the sex ratio of the next 1,000 newborns but not the sexes of my own two children, the historian can recognize factors that made inevitable broad outcome of the collision between American and Eurasian societies after 13,000 years of separate developments, but not the outcome of the 1960 U.S. presidential election. The details of which candidate said what during a single televised debate in October 1960 could have given a total victory to Nixon instead of to Kennedy, but no details of who said what could have blocked the European conquest of Native Americans.

这本书（中文译本《枪炮、病菌和钢铁》）从大的地理范围和时间尺度上，解释了“为什么在不同的地区，人类历史会按照如此不同的方式展开？”，具体来说，“为什么是欧洲人最终征服世界上的其他地方，而不是反过来？”。作者从人类走出非洲大陆和迁徙到全球开始讲起，通过对比，论述了食物生产（即对植物和动物的驯化、圈养）对人类早期社会的决定性作用，由此而产生更大更复杂的社会组织，形成稠密的人口，使得致病菌在人与人、人与动物、动物与动物之间的传播更容易，当然也使得发明和技术的交流和传播更容易，从而形成了在技术（包括武器）、致病菌和社会组织（注：书中将文字单独列出来，我认为文字也可以归类为技术）上对于没有食物生产或者起步较晚的社会形成压倒性甚至是毁灭性的优势。这也就解释了为什么中国南方沿海的人能取代东南亚和南太平洋诸岛的原住民、欧洲人能取代美洲和澳洲原住民、非洲班图人能取代沙哈拉以南非洲的大部分原住民，以及欧洲人能实现对非洲和亚洲的殖民统治。

这部横跨13000年的人类学著作，给了我一个对于“我们是谁，我们从哪里来？”的较清晰的答案。而书中一再强调的观念是：一个人类社会的成功，并不是因为这个社会的人种优于其他社会的人种，而只是因为偶然的地理和生态上的差异，造成了某些社会有更好的条件能实现“枪炮、病菌和钢铁”的优势。因此，“欧洲中心论”是显然不成立的。类似地，中国的“天朝上国”思想（比如说：中国有着延续最久的古老文明，古代人类的重要发明都是中国人首先创造的）也是不科学的。

书中提到让我惊讶的两个事实：一是现在东南亚和南太平洋诸岛（远至夏威夷）的人都是很早以前从中国东南沿海迁徙过去的，并消灭和取代了当地的人民（几内亚岛除外）。由此看来，从整个人类历史来看，迁徙、扩张、占领、融合、征服甚至是灭绝，从来没有间断。而所谓中国人自古以来就没有侵略性，没有扩张的野心，可能只是一种管中窥豹。二是现今马达加斯加岛上生活的人，一部分是黑人，另一部分是印尼人，而全岛所使用的语言，也和印尼的语言是同一个起源（这让我联想到曾经见过的一个马达加斯加人，长相上确实和东南亚人相似）。也就是说，印尼人在相当早的时候，就有一只庞大舰队带着一大群人（已经得到考古结果的证实）跨越了印度洋殖民了马达加斯加，书中作者推测一种可能性是他们先打到印度，再转而去往非洲。无论如何，这不得不说都是人类历史上的一次创举。

书中提到我的知识盲点的两个事实：一是如今撒哈拉以南的非洲，居住的大部分是班图人，而从各个角度的研究可以推测，班图人也是几千年前从非洲西海岸中间开始，由于培育出农作物，获得了对相邻社会的竞争优势，从而不断往东和往南扩张。二是原本澳大利亚和新几内亚是同一块大陆，后来因为海平面的上升，两者分开，而两边的人类也从此走向不同的发展轨迹。

所谓“读史可以明智”，而这个“智”是基于历史带给人的广阔视野，让我们不再陷入对当下的执念乃至焦虑。正如当我们想想宇宙的漫长和浩渺的时候，我们当前所面对的困境、不安和挫折，都显得无足轻重，而我们要做的，就是在自己的人生中，谱写属于自己的壮丽多彩的历史。

诸君共勉之。
